### Purpose
As a dispatcher, i often find myself wondering "How many calls did I answer during the last week"?
Yes, of course, i can wait untill the weekend and see the "weekly summary", i can also check in my phone in call log and count them, but, well - i'm lazy.

### So, what did i do?
The solution is simple: i built an app that goes into my phone call logs, filter only the wanted calls (In my case: Yedidim call center) and display them in a nicly way.

### What can i see?
In this app you can see:
- In a nice and large card - all calls from the 30 last days.
- A list of all the calls in the 30 last days, with all the details, such as date, length type and stuff.
- Some pretty charts.
- A few statistics cards.
- Yes, ofc you can configure the filters, sure.

So, please enjoy!
